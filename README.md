 ## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point for the application.
- It will contain the necessary HTML structure, including the header, navigation bar, and main content area.
- The main content area will display the form for users to input the document they want to review.

**2. results.html**
- This HTML file will display the results of the analysis performed by the Flask application.
- It will include the recommendations and rewrites suggested by the Assistant to improve the document's adherence to the Why, What, and How methodology.

### Routes

**1. /index**
- This route will handle the rendering of the index.html file.
- It will be the default route for the application, meaning it will be accessed when users first visit the application.

**2. /analyze**
- This route will handle the analysis of the document provided by the user.
- It will receive the document as input, perform the necessary analysis, and generate the recommendations and rewrites.
- The results will then be displayed in the results.html file.

**3. /about**
- This route will handle the rendering of an about page, providing information about the application and its purpose.

**4. /contact**
- This route will handle the rendering of a contact page, providing contact information for the application's developers.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should include a mechanism for users to upload their documents, such as a file upload form.
- The application should provide a way for users to view the original document alongside the recommendations and rewrites.
- The application should be designed to be responsive, ensuring it can be accessed and used on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.
